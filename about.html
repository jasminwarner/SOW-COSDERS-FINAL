    My name is Jasmin and this is the website I created focusing on a  way to help 
   the lack of creative spaces for youth, like myself, who love Visual Arts. I am 
   very passionate about Visual Arts, mainly Film and Photography, and got frustrated 
   of 
   there not being enough opportunities for me to showcase and learn more about my 
   craft. Even when there were available opportunities, they came with a very big 
    price tag so I was not able to participate. I beleive this solution would be one 
    of the best ways to deal with my social issue because it gives youth a free space 
   to express themselves.  </p>
